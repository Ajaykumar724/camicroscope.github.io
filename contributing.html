        <p>caMicroscope is an open-source distributed platform, and we welcome contributions from the community. Before you start contributing, here are some important guidelines and information to help you get involved.</p>
        <h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Code Repository:</strong> Our development occurs in various repositories. The best place to start is the distribution repository, which contains a docker-compose container manifest for easy platform deployment. For development purposes, we also provide a special manifest, <code>develop.yml</code>, which disables some security features and uses edge code.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Using the UI:</strong> You can interact with caMicroscope through the user interface, which defaults to port 4010. Use this UI to load and explore images.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="development-workflow">Development Workflow</h3>
        <p>We follow the <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub Flow</a> for code changes, which means all changes happen through pull requests. Here&#39;s a step-by-step guide to our development process: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Fork the Repository:</strong> To get started, fork the repository you want to contribute to. This will create a copy in your own GitHub account.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Create a Branch:</strong> For each contribution, create a new branch from the main repository. Use a descriptive name that explains your change.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Make Changes:</strong> Make the necessary code changes, following our coding standards and guidelines.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Testing:</strong> Ensure your changes are thoroughly tested. Provide test cases if applicable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Create a Pull Request:</strong> Once your changes are ready, open a pull request against the original repository&#39;s main branch. Write a clear description of the changes you&#39;ve made.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Code Review:</strong> Our team will review your pull request. Be prepared to address feedback and make necessary adjustments.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Merge:</strong> Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>We actively welcome your pull requests. However, we do not typically assign pull requests without a clear reason for a specific person to work on them.</p>
        <h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>
        <p>To make your contribution process smoother, consider working on topic branches from your fork of the repository. Keep your master or develop branch up-to-date with the upstream repositories. You can refer to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/anjohnson/8994c95ab2a06f7d2339">Triangle Workflows Guide</a> for guidance on using Git this way. </p>
        <h3 id="reporting-issues">Reporting Issues</h3>
        <p>If you encounter issues, create issues and pull requests against the most relevant repository where the change should take place. Reporting issues effectively helps us improve caMicroscope. When submitting a bug report, provide as much detail as possible:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A quick summary and/or background.</li>
          <li>Clear steps to reproduce the issue. Be specific and provide sample code if you can.</li>
          <li>Describe what you expected to happen.</li>
          <li>Explain what actually happened.</li>
          <li>Include screenshots if they can help illustrate the problem.</li>
          <li>State the device, platform, and versions you are using.</li>
          <li>Share any relevant notes, including why you think the issue might be happening or any attempts you made to resolve it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="reporting-issues">Requesting Features</h3>
        <p>If you have ideas for new features or improvements to caMicroscope, we encourage you to propose them. Clear and well-documented feature proposals help us understand your vision and make informed decisions. When proposing a new feature, follow these guidelines:</p>
